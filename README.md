### Number Guesser Project

Week 2 Turing FE Project

Application allows 2 users to play a game of guessing with a randomly generated number in between the ranges set by the users.  The game evaluates if the guess was to high, to low, or the correct guess and creates a winner card.

### Lessons Learned
Unfortunately I had very poor time management and didn't spend alot of time on the project and was rushed at the end, therefore the code is not very clean or dry.  It was good to get repetition in, but having a vision on how I wanted to write the code and being rushed exhibited poor, sloppy code.  I intend to work on managing time better as well as spending time to build out the rest of the functionalities more efficiently and refactor the code base.
